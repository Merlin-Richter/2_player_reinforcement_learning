# 2 Player Reinforcement Learning

This repository takes us through the full reinforcement learning landscape for 2 Player games. Starting with a simple state_dict for TicTacToe and ending with an implementation of AlphaZero for Go

copy the Repo and start going through the different Agents starting at A and going down the alphabet.

This Projekt is currently unfinnished and on standby, because I have too much to do at the moment :)

Have fun leaning :D
